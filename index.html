        <h2>Origin and design</h2>

        <p>Although details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during production 
            of Star Wars, the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter 
            was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a "Death Star" to concept 
            artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film 2001: 
            A Space Odyssey. In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that "I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to 
            have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they 
            met across the middle." As it "would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression," 
            Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea, and the Death Star model was 
            created by John Stears. The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from 
            the Flash Gordon serials. Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial 
            Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi. Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was 
            completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film. Both Death Stars were depicted by a 
            combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.</p>

        <h2>Special effects</h2>
        
        <p>The Death Star explosions featured in the special edition of A New Hope and in Return of the Jedi are rendered with 
            a Praxis effect, wherein a flat ring of matter erupts from the explosion. The grid plan animations shown during 
            the Rebel briefing for the attack on the Death Star late in A New Hope were an actual computer graphics simulation 
            from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory made by Larry Cuba and Gary Imhoff as part of a CalArts project, and had been 
            included during filming</p>
